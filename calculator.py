# Welcome to the fun Calculator
# Ask the user to input the first mumber
num1 = float(input( "Enter the first number:"))
# Ask the user to input the second number
num2 = float (input ( "Enter the second number:"))
# Time to do the Mathematics now welcome.
# Add the two numbers
sum_result = num1 + num2 
# Subtract the two numbers 
difference_result = num1 + num2 
# Multiply th two numbers
product_result = num1 * num2 
# Divide the two numbers
quotient_result = num1 / num2 
# Show the user the result of our software product 
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}") # Addition
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}") # Subtraction
print(f"Product: {product_result}") #Multiplication
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
# And you have just made a simple calculator.
